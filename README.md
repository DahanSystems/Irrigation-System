# Arduino Irrigation-System
An automated irrigation system, Powered by Arduino, designed to optimize plant watering by using a soil moisture sensor. The system monitors soil moisture levels in real time and activates a water pump to provide the right amount of water when needed. this project is ideal for home gardens or small-scale farming.
for this project I used :

1. Arduino UNO R3
2. Moisture Sensor for arduino
3. 12V DC sunk water pump
4. 5V relay module
5. 12V to 5V USB DC/DC converter 
6. 12V 5A DC power supplier.
7. a connector from the DV power supply to 2 Pin. (depands on the type of 12V DC power jack you have)
8. 16x2 Character LCD Display(optional, to show moisture precentages and status) + potentiometer(to control the brightness).
9. USB male to female cable (helps uploading the code to the arduino when all the parts are connected)
10. jumper cables, breadboard, arduino cover etc.
11. box for storing all the components.
